# COMP 228: System Hardware
## This repo contains the assembled program written for MARIE architecture.
### The small program simply does a multiplying of 2 numbers and ask for user input until receives "!" to terminate.

# Instruction:
### There are 2 ways to stimulate MARIE:
## Via an online platform using JavaScript.
  * Copy everything inside [mult.mas](https://github.com/DukeNgn/COMP228/blob/master/Multiplying/mult.mas). [Source of the website](https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js).
  * Go to this [MARIE online simulator](https://marie.js.org/).
  [Repo of the platform](https://github.com/MARIE-js/MARIE.js).
  * Paste the copied code into the text editor.
  * Assemble => Run.
##Via a Java Virtual Machine. Download from [here](http://computerscience.jbpub.com/ecoa/3e/simulators.aspx)
 * Clone this repo.
 * Open MarieSim.jar after unzip the downloaded package
 * Load the file mult.mex inside the repo.
 (mult.mex is an assembled file from the source code so you do not have to assemble the source code again to execute the program)
 * Run.
